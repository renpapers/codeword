## SKO STATEMENT

Before this studio, I had 0 knowledge and experience with coding - but since the beginning of this year, the digital realm of design has peaked my interest (as my practice is normally involved with hand drawn illustrations). I now have a newfound craving to learn more about coding in the art and design world, and how it opens contemporary borders that holds a digital beauty where narrative is built through numbers, letters and syntax. A new version of trialling  and experimenting, and a new utmost frustration when there's an error in your code has more relations to art than I originally thought before this studio. Throughout this year I aimed to experiment with other aspects of design digitally, and I'm glad to say this studio has only further peaked my curiousity and motivated attitude to learn more abot Processing, and perhaps other platforms code can be written on. I wish to further finetune my knowledge in code, as I believe it's such a strong tool that brings out a new format in design that has the ability to spark wonder and emotion. I hope to use this archive as a home base for reflection and providing progress works, as well as newfound thoughts and ideas for current/future projects relating to design and code. This studio focuses on reading in digital spaces: from games to code - a new contemporary alternative to reading text from a book. I believe this is vital to help grow the design industry and keep up with upcoming technological trends. Utilising Processing under the p5js format, wonderful outcomes were created as we tested our limits and capacity to build a visually interesting outcome that served purpose and profound depth. 

Akin to my normal philosophy in art and design; my aim was to somehow connect with an audience through an emotional lense that produces submering, entrancing atmospheres of the sort - through a different and very new platform to me: code. To me, picking up this studio was a challenge, as I hoped to end this course with newfound insights and interests among the skillset I've already collected and refined.
