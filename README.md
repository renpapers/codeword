## SKO STATEMENT

Before this studio, I had 0 knowledge and experience with coding - but since the beginning of this year, the digital realm of design has peaked my interest (as my practice is normally involved with hand drawn illustrations). I now have a newfound craving to learn more about coding in the art and design world, and how it opens contemporary borders that holds a digital beauty where narrative is built through numbers, letters and syntax. A new version of trialling  and experimenting, and a new utmost frustration when there's an error in your code has more relations to art than I originally thought before this studio. Throughout this year I aimed to experiment with other aspects of design digitally, and I'm glad to say this studio has only further peaked my curiousity and motivated attitude to learn more abot Processing, and perhaps other platforms code can be written on. I wish to further finetunr my knowledge of code, as I believe it's such a strong tool that brings out a new format in design,
