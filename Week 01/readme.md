# A Whole New World 

Intro to reading through online platforms, talked about HOW we read online and the difference between reading online and on paper (twitter = short statements).  

An intro to minecraft: not being an avid player of minecraft, I was sceptical of what we'd be learning through the game, but as I followed along through Flinders St Station whilst Andy and Karen were talking, I felt like i was a protagonist to some sort of film or book. It was interesting how immersive this sensation felt, and opened my eyes to how narratives are created through virtual games.

With Karens help, we began our tutorial on processing and how code functions through this format of p5js - changing colours using the mousex/mousey functions, how to create shapes, and some concrete information on the basic fundementals of code. This being my first time utilising processing and code in a design format, I realised how interactive your artworks and designs can be as a user just by the simple click of a mouse. [here is a link to what we worked on!](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/laurensfirstsketchprogress/)

As a set task, we were told to mess around with processing and create a letter from our first (or last) names. Although mine being (extremely) rudimentary and admittedly not the most appealing visually, I again tried to mess around with the mousex/mousey functions, as well as curved shapes. Again, this being my first time coding I struggled to wrap my head around certain concepts, but eventually managed to get the hang of it! [Here's the final outcome](http://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/L_sketch_yay)
