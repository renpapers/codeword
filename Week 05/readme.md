# WEEK 5

It was time to present our group projects for our first assignment this class! I was blown away by how everyone interpreted and created new worlds for this very specific text (one thing that stuck in my head was the Club Penguins group and the tunnel scene). Considering every game had their own restrictions, the way these issues were resolved if anything further highlighted the charms of each game, and provided a new narrative for the book which I adored. As for our group, we overall had great feedback from the class, and did some minor edits/changes before submission such as text colour and sizing for eligibility. I'd have to say my favourite scene from our group's video is the library one, there was an unsettling still presence in that room that I couldn't shake off.

We associated dim, warm lighting and red undertones with the more profound, intense scenes - depicting a sinister mood; juxtaposing the common concept of warm lighting being comforting and joyfu - a factor I too really loved as part of our project. A wiip was also created, which consisted of our overall process and rationalising our thoughts, [here's a link](https://wiip.co/THE-HORRORS-OF-ANIMAL-CROSSING.b-MEgcptSZluo8jwq7Tsi/)

The second half of this lesson Andy discussed with us our next assignment and the reading we'll be choosing. We split into groups to analyse a text from the pool Andy provided us, and Nat and I decdied to look into 'Other Spaces' by Michael Foucault. The text discusses the definition of space itself, and how it's been defined in multiple stances and contexts. It also questions the boundaries of space, and the unlimitless ephemerality in instances such as utopia’s - and how we relate this to physical spaces that are akin (heterotopia’s). I found Foucault's theories quite intruiging on the perception of space and it’s absence; using the analogy of mirror that causes us to further contemplate the reality of this physical world we live in, and questioning whether the mirror is portraying real life. 

I'll spend the rest of this week sifting through these wonderful texts and deciding on which one to choose for our next assignment, but this 'Other Spaces' work opened up many visuals in my head, that I believe may be suited for a sketch via web - I'll have to do a bit more reading I suppose.
