#WEEK 5

It was time to present our group projects for our first assignment this class! I was blown away by how everyone interpreted and created new worlds for this very specific text (one thing that stuck in my head was the Club Penguins group and the tunnel scene). Considering every game had their own restrictions, the way these issues were resolved if anything further highlighted the charms of each game, and provided a new narrative for the book which I adored. As for our group, we overall had great feedback from the class, and did some minor edits/changes before submission such as text colour and sizing for eligibility. I'd have to say my favourite scene from our group's video is the library one, there was an unsettling still presence in that room that I couldn't shake off.

We associated dim, warm lighting and red undertones with the more profound, intense scenes - depicting a sinister mood; juxtaposing the common concept of warm lighting being comforting and joyfu - a factor I too really loved as part of our project. A wiip was also created, which consisted of our overall process and rationalising our thoughts, [here's a link](https://wiip.co/THE-HORRORS-OF-ANIMAL-CROSSING.b-MEgcptSZluo8jwq7Tsi/)

Next assignment and the readings: trouble with choosing mine: I've come to realise I myself enjoy analysing texts and theories, rather than someone else doing them for me which is perhaps why I've been having trouble choosing a text for our next assignment (all texts being based on critical theories). Fortunately Andy allowed me to further self explore a piece of my own, and I decided to find myself an analysis on Haruki Murakami's writings - one of my favourite authors. His works, although having a 'simplistic' writing structure brings our a depth in his stories and characters that immerse readers into his worlds - and I've always wanted to further discover his methods to doing so. 

Group text discussion:
The text discusses the definition of space, and how it’s been defined in multiple stances and contexts.

Questioning the boundaries of space, and the unlimitless ephemerality in instances such as utopia’s - and how we relate this to physical spaces that are akin (heterotopia’s). Inbetween the two lies a ‘mirror’. 

Perception of space and it’s absence, using the analogy of mirror caused us to further contemplate the reality of this physical world we live in. Questioning if the mirror is portraying real life. 

Public space, private space, social space, family space
