# WEEK 10: DEBUGGING AND TRIALLING

This week we continued to work on our main project. Continuing off my thoughts from last week, I decided to create more content in my sketch and add in a quote in my sketch that permanently remains stationary, whilst the user clicks around creating stars and the letters 'HARUKI MURAKAMI' - this concept has still remained the same, although I am reconsidering the notion of having Murakami's name popping up whenever the user clicks - what is the true purpose of this? I suppose I wanted to expose how this project was essentially about the authors works, and I wanted a visual that would represent this notion. 

On a [separate sketch](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/AT2_trial3/), I managed to create a fading in and out effect for the stationary quote, which I thought worked well with my overall atmosphere as the words dip in and out of a users screen - adding a more so dynamic effect to my sketch. Although simple, I really loved the slow animation this produced, bringing me to a sort of calm lull - an ambience I'd love to bring into the sketch when finalised. 

I combined this quote with my original code (view sketch [here](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/AT2_Trial5/)), although for some reason the fading effect stopped functioning, and the size changes according to the mousePressed function - I believe I'll need to separate the two somehow (NOTE: ASK KAREN/ANDY ABOUT THIS). Although I still wanted to add more to this sketch and move on, I needed to figure out these small steps first. A big shout out to Jamie in my class for helping me out - what a coding wizz honestly.

I managed to split the my sentence into separate letters per mouse click by creating a class (aka how I like to describe it: a bag of stars!), and pusuhing this class into the mousePressed function  and centre the letters in the middle of the circle. Andy mentioned perhaps to either choose the letter, or the circle to be used for the mousePressed as he didn't see the point in having both visually/conceptually - this is a point I may have to rethink. You can view my current up to date sketch [here](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/AT2_Trial6/). A fair amount of debugging was done from last week, where I managed to make the quote stationary, not changing sizes with the mousePressed function in my code

## What I neeed to do this week: 
- individual split of letters from 'haruki murakami' sentence
- space bar key clearing the page so it doesn't get too messy, or perhaps creating a max amount of circles/letters for the mousePressed function may be easier.
