# WEEK 10: DEBUGGING AND TRIALLING

## FIRST THOUGH: SOME STARRY INSPIRATION!

Ever since first year, stars have always drawn me in (in fact, for my final group project during 2nd semester of first year, I painted a 3m canvas full of gold stars as part of the final outcome - playing with the use of 'set design' in a very DIY manner). As a sort of nostalgic image (a concept Strecher discusses in the text I'm using for this project), I thought I'd show them here too. There's a wonder and beauty to a sky full of stars, where a tranquil silence fills the air - an emotion I often attempt to recreate in my art/design.  This idea subconsciously came into play when reading my chosen text, and drove me to produce a poetic sketch for this project.

Another inspiration I've read up on recently (still not code... but still very starry!) is an art installation by Yayoi Kusama called "Infinity Mirrored Room", held at the David Zwirner gallery in New York. Yayoi focuses her entire art work on the concept of 'infinity', where you walk through an endless room of time and space. The room being rilled with mirrors is seemingly infinite as hanging lights creates a visual galaxy or nebula. Akin to how captivating and immersive a installation experience can be (like this one), I hope to create a sort of visually enchanting piece that lets an audience wander around the screen.

This week we continued to work on our main project. Continuing off my thoughts from last week, I decided to create more content in my sketch and add in a quote in my sketch that permanently remains stationary, whilst the user clicks around creating stars and the letters 'HARUKI MURAKAMI' - this concept has still remained the same, although I am reconsidering the notion of having Murakami's name popping up whenever the user clicks - what is the true purpose of this? I suppose I wanted to expose how this project was essentially about the authors works, and I wanted a visual that would represent this notion. 

On a [separate sketch](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/AT2_trial3/), I managed to create a fading in and out effect for the stationary quote, which I thought worked well with my overall atmosphere as the words dip in and out of a users screen - adding a more so dynamic effect to my sketch. Although simple, I really loved the slow animation this produced, bringing me to a sort of calm lull - an ambience I'd love to bring into the sketch when finalised. 

I combined this quote with my original code (view sketch [here](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/AT2_Trial5/)), although for some reason the fading effect stopped functioning, and the size changes according to the mousePressed function - I believe I'll need to separate the two somehow (NOTE: ASK KAREN/ANDY ABOUT THIS). Although I still wanted to add more to this sketch and move on, I needed to figure out these small steps first. A big shout out to Jamie in my class for helping me out - what a coding wizz honestly.

I managed to split the my sentence into separate letters per mouse click by creating a class (aka how I like to describe it: a bag of stars!), and pusuhing this class into the mousePressed function  and centre the letters in the middle of the circle. Andy mentioned perhaps to either choose the letter, or the circle to be used for the mousePressed as he didn't see the point in having both visually/conceptually - this is a point I may have to rethink. You can view my current up to date sketch [here](https://renpapers.github.io/codeword/Processing%20Sketches/AT2_Trial6/). A fair amount of debugging was done from last week, where I managed to make the quote stationary, not changing sizes with the mousePressed function in my code

## What I neeed to do this week: 
- Reconsider what should be created when using the mousePressed function
- Find music to add in 
- space bar key clearing the page so it doesn't get too messy, or perhaps creating a max amount of circles/letters for the mousePressed function may be easier.
