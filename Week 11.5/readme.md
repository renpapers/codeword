# WEEK 11.5 

Since last week's (week 11) had quite a lot of text, I thought it would be better to split my additional information/discoveries here. Although not added into my code yet, I shortlisted a few songs as options for my sketch. A few of them were songs I recalled from some of Murakami's books. I also found a spotify playlist of the songs he mentions in his works too. I remember reading an interview from the New Yorker, where he mentions how music is part of his process in writing, and I suppose it helps add to the atmosphere and mood of a visual piece too. Therefore I figured I'd use one of his songs he mentions in a book. 

[Here's the spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6pEMWyjkKbufHyRZ7QZiaS?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Asdmeslow%3Aplaylist%3A6pEMWyjkKbufHyRZ7QZiaS&utm_source=embed_v2&go=1&play=1&nd=1)
