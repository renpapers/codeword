# WIP 

GALAXY STARS TESTING - Andy suggested sparking small letters using mouse pressed, having them burst into the space I've created. Now this was something I actually already considered beforehand, but thought would be too difficult to do, or thought I wouldn't have the time to create. Once Andy raised the idea back into my mind, I figured I might as well try it, no harm right?

After following a couple tutorials (sources in code!) and altering it accordingly to what I wanted to create, this is what I came up with!

Altering and changing some more, so the dots burst out in random directions rather than horizontally (some debugging was done, and I realised it was due to a few spelling errors... woops)

Here's me now, attempting to replace the ellipses with letters - it kind of worked?

What I need to add this week onto my code:

- glow effect on circles
- fade effect on mousepressed function
- add sound/music
- change typeface


If I have extra time: 
- hyperlink circles/realities to another page 
- Get more stars to spark whenever using mousepressed function
